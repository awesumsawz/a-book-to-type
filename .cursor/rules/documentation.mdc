# Comprehensive Documentation Cursor Rule

## Purpose

Establish a unified documentation process that:
- Automatically aggregates and updates documentation.
- Organizes documentation files logically by feature.
- Ensures continuity by referencing prior decisions during onboarding and next-step planning.

## Directory and File Organization

- **Root Documentation Directory:**  
  All documentation is managed within the `documentation/` directory.
  
- **Feature Grouping:**  
  - For distinct features, use dedicated files (e.g., `documentation/user-authentication.md`).
  - For complex features, establish subdirectories (e.g., `documentation/payment-processing/`) with an `_index.md` file summarizing the featureâ€™s documentation.
  
- **Master Index File:**  
  Maintain a master index (`documentation/_index.md`) to list and link all feature-specific files and directories for easy navigation.

## When to Update Documentation

- **Onboarding:**  
  At the beginning of every new session or when context is reintroduced, review the relevant documentation files to ensure alignment with previous decisions.
  
- **During Feature Development:**  
  Update the corresponding feature file(s) with new insights, decisions, or modifications as tasks progress.
  
- **At Significant Milestones:**  
  Immediately following important decisions or changes, append a new entry to the appropriate documentation file(s).

## Documentation Entry Structure

Each update should follow a consistent format:

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Session Update: <Brief Title>

**Summary:**
- A concise description of the changes or decisions made.

**Key Decisions:**
- Bullet points summarizing critical choices and the rationale behind them.

**Next Steps:**
- Recommended follow-up actions or future considerations.
