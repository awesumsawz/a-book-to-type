# Implementation Status

## Initial Implementation

### 2023-05-24 Session Update: Core Application Implementation

**Summary:**
- Implemented the initial version of the typing practice application with all core functionality.

**Key Components:**

1. **File Upload System**
   - Created a drag-and-drop file upload interface using react-dropzone
   - Implemented file type validation (PDF, TXT, RTF, DOCX)
   - Added error handling for failed uploads

2. **Text Processing**
   - Implemented PDF text extraction using pdf-parse
   - Added OCR capabilities using Tesseract.js for image-based PDF content
   - Created text processing utilities for different file formats

3. **Typing Interface**
   - Developed an interactive typing interface with character-by-character validation
   - Added real-time highlighting of current position, errors, and completed text
   - Implemented play/pause and restart functionality

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Created WPM and accuracy calculation algorithms
   - Developed detailed metrics display with session statistics
   - Implemented progress tracking and historical performance records

5. **Progress Persistence**
   - Developed localStorage-based session storage for progress saving
   - Created utilities for saving and retrieving user data
   - Implemented automatic progress tracking

**Key Decisions:**
- Used Next.js App Router for routing and page structure
- Leveraged client-side components for interactive elements
- Chose localStorage for session persistence for simplicity in MVP
- Implemented modular component structure for maintainability
- Used pdf-parse and Tesseract.js for PDF processing

**Next Steps:**
- Enhance OCR capabilities for better accuracy with complex PDFs
- Add server-side storage for user data persistence across devices
- Implement DOCX file processing
- Create more detailed error pattern analysis
- Add customization options for the typing interface (themes, font sizes)
