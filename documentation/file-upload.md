# File Upload Feature

## Overview
The file upload feature allows users to upload PDF documents and text files for typing practice. The system will extract text from these files and convert it into a format suitable for the typing interface.

## Requirements

### Supported File Types
- PDF documents
- Plain text files (.txt)
- Rich text files (.rtf)
- Word documents (.docx)

### Processing Capabilities
- Direct text extraction from PDF files when possible
- OCR processing for image-based PDF content
- Text extraction from various document formats

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Components
- File upload dropzone component
- File type validation
- Upload progress indicator
- Error handling UI

### Server-Side Processing
- Secure file storage (temporary)
- PDF text extraction using a library like pdf.js or pdf-parse
- OCR integration for image-based content (Tesseract.js)
- Text cleaning and normalization

### Security Considerations
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file handling
- No permanent storage of original files after processing

## Data Flow
1. User selects or drags file to upload area
2. Client validates file type and size
3. File is uploaded to server
4. Server processes file to extract text
5. Extracted text is stored in the database associated with the user
6. User is redirected to typing interface with the processed text

### 2023-05-24 Session Update: File Upload Feature Planning

**Summary:**
- Defined requirements and implementation details for the file upload feature.

**Key Decisions:**
- Selected pdf.js or pdf-parse for PDF text extraction.
- Decided to use Tesseract.js for OCR capabilities.
- Determined that original files should not be stored permanently after processing.

**Next Steps:**
- Create the file upload component.
- Implement server-side API routes for file processing.
- Research and test PDF extraction libraries for the best performance.
