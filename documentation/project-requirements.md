# Project Requirements

## Purpose
Develop an interactive typing practice and speed app designed to help users improve their typing skills while engaging with meaningful text content. 

## Core Requirements

### 1. Input Handling
- **Supported Formats:**
  - Allow users to upload PDFs and other common text file formats
  - For PDFs, implement functionality to extract text directly when possible
  - Use OCR (e.g., Tesseract) when the text is embedded as images

### 2. Text Processing and Display
- **Text Conversion:**
  - Convert the uploaded text from the file (via direct extraction or OCR) into an accessible format stored in memory
- **Typing Interface:**
  - Display the processed text as a "dimmed prompt" where it serves as a background guideline
  - Ensure the interface supports both accuracy and speed training

### 3. User Metrics & Progress Tracking
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Monitor detailed typing metrics, including words per minute, accuracy percentages, and common error patterns
- **Session Persistence:**
  - Save the user's progress so that they can exit the app and later resume from where they left off
  - Use an appropriate storage solution to securely manage user sessions and historical performance data

### 4. Technology & Implementation
- **Stack:**
  - Next.js with App Router 
  - React 19
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement error handling for file processing (e.g., unsupported formats, OCR failures)
  - Inform the user and allow for corrective actions

### 5. Overall Goals
- **Dual-Purpose Functionality:**
  - Provide a tool that improves typing speed and accuracy through repetitive practice
  - Offer a way to interact with and learn from meaningful text
- **User Experience:**
  - Design a user-friendly interface with clear instructions
  - Ensure the app is accessible to all levels of typists

### 2023-05-24 Session Update: Initial Requirements Documentation

**Summary:**
- Documented the initial project requirements based on user specifications.

**Key Decisions:**
- Identified Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS as the core technology stack.
- Established clear requirements for file upload handling, text processing, and user metrics.

**Next Steps:**
- Create component architecture for the application.
- Research PDF processing libraries compatible with Next.js.
- Design database schema for storing user progress.
