# User Metrics and Progress Tracking

## Overview
The user metrics system tracks and analyzes typing performance, providing users with valuable insights into their progress and areas for improvement. The system also enables session persistence, allowing users to resume practice from where they left off.

## Metrics Tracked

### Performance Metrics
- **Words Per Minute (WPM)**: Speed calculation based on standard word length (5 characters)
- **Accuracy Percentage**: Ratio of correctly typed characters to total characters
- **Raw Speed**: Total keystrokes per minute, regardless of accuracy
- **Net Speed**: Adjusted speed that accounts for errors
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of errors made during typing

### Error Pattern Analysis
- **Common Mistakes**: Frequently mistyped characters or words
- **Heat Map**: Visual representation of error frequency by keyboard position
- **Improvement Areas**: Suggested focus areas based on error patterns

### Progress Over Time
- **Historical Performance**: Tracking of metrics across multiple sessions
- **Improvement Graphs**: Visual representation of progress over time
- **Achievement System**: Milestones and badges for reaching specific goals

## Session Persistence

### Data Storage
- **Current Position**: Tracking the user's position within a document
- **Session State**: Current settings and preferences for the typing interface
- **Document Progress**: Percentage completion for each document

### Implementation
- **Client-Side Storage**: Local storage for temporary session data
- **Server-Side Storage**: Database for long-term progress tracking
- **Synchronization**: Mechanism to reconcile client and server data

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models
- User model with progress and performance history
- Session model for in-progress typing sessions
- Error pattern model for tracking and analyzing mistakes

### Storage Solutions
- Browser localStorage for immediate session persistence
- Server database for long-term data storage and analysis
- Regular synchronization between client and server

### Privacy Considerations
- User opt-in for data collection beyond session persistence
- Anonymous data aggregation for platform-wide statistics
- Clear data retention policies

### 2023-05-24 Session Update: User Metrics System Planning

**Summary:**
- Defined comprehensive metrics and progress tracking capabilities for the typing application.

**Key Decisions:**
- Selected key performance indicators: WPM, accuracy percentage, error patterns.
- Planned both client-side and server-side storage mechanisms for different data persistence needs.
- Designed a progress tracking system that provides actionable insights to users.

**Next Steps:**
- Create data models for user metrics and session persistence.
- Implement algorithms for calculating typing performance metrics.
- Design UI components for displaying performance data and progress.
