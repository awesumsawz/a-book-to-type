# Typing Interface

## Overview
The typing interface is the core interactive component of the application where users practice their typing skills. It displays text from uploaded documents and allows users to type along while tracking their performance metrics.

## Key Features

### Text Display
- Text presented as a "dimmed prompt" serving as a background guideline
- Current word/character highlighting
- Visual indication of typing progress
- Responsive layout that works across device sizes

### Typing Input
- Real-time text input field
- Error highlighting for mistyped characters
- Visual feedback for correct typing
- Support for both accuracy and speed-focused modes

### Performance Tracking
- Words per minute (WPM) calculation
- Accuracy percentage
- Error pattern identification
- Visual representation of progress (charts/graphs)
- Real-time feedback during typing sessions

## User Experience

### Interface Layout
- Clean, distraction-free design
- High contrast text for readability
- Customizable appearance options (font size, color schemes, etc.)
- Keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### Session Controls
- Start/pause/resume functionality
- Session timer display
- Option to restart current section
- Save progress and exit capability

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- TextDisplay: Renders the text to be typed with proper formatting and highlighting
- TypingInput: Captures user keyboard input and validates against expected text
- PerformanceMetrics: Calculates and displays typing statistics
- SessionControls: Provides interface for managing the typing session

### State Management
- Track current position in text
- Maintain typing statistics for the session
- Record error patterns and problematic characters
- Store session progress for later resumption
