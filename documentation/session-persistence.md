### [2024-08-23] Session Update: Session Persistence Implementation

**Summary:**
- Implemented session persistence using browser `localStorage`.
- The `Home` component now checks `localStorage` for a saved state (`text`, `progress`) on initial load.
- If saved state exists, it's loaded, and the typing session resumes from the saved point (`currentIndex`, `errors`, `typedCharsStatus`, `startTime`, `totalTyped`).
- `TypingArea` was modified to accept `initialProgress` and initialize its state accordingly.
- Typing progress (including character statuses and start time) is now saved to `localStorage` via the `handleProgressUpdate` callback in the `Home` component.
- Saved state is automatically cleared when a new text is loaded via file upload or pasting.
- Added an `isLoaded` state in `Home` to prevent rendering issues before the saved state is checked.

**Key Decisions:**
- Use `localStorage` for simplicity in this phase.
- Store the original text along with the detailed progress object.
- Define a `TypingProgress` interface (exported from `TypingArea`) to structure the saved/loaded data.
- Initialize `TypingArea` state using functional updates (`useState(() => ...)`) to correctly handle initial values from props.
- Save state on every `onProgressUpdate` call triggered by `TypingArea`.
- Handle potential errors during loading/saving from `localStorage`.
- Use an `initialProgress` prop to pass the loaded state down, distinct from normal resets triggered by `triggerReset`.
- Clear `localStorage` explicitly when `handleTextChange` is called.

**Next Steps:**
- Implement PDF/OCR handling for file uploads.
- Refine UI/UX aspects (e.g., end-of-test summary, providing an explicit 'Save Session' button instead of auto-save, clearer loading state).
- Consider alternative storage solutions if scalability or cross-device persistence is required.
