### [2024-08-23] Session Update: PDF/OCR, Completion, Reset, Styling & Toasts

**Summary:**
- Installed `pdfjs-dist` and `tesseract.js` dependencies.
- Updated the `InputArea` component to handle `.pdf` file uploads.
- Implemented direct text extraction from PDFs using `pdfjs-dist`.
- Configured the `pdfjs-dist` worker source for browser compatibility.
- Added a loading state (`isLoading`, `loadingMessage`) to provide user feedback during file processing.
- Included basic cleanup for extracted PDF text (trimming, normalizing whitespace).
- Implemented an OCR fallback using `Tesseract.js` (`processWithOcr`) for PDFs where direct text extraction yields insufficient results (below a character threshold).
- Added support for direct OCR processing of common image file types (PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP).
- Updated the file input `accept` attribute to reflect all supported types.
- Improved Tesseract.js logging to provide more detailed status updates during OCR.
- Added specific error handling for PDF extraction failures vs. OCR failures.
- Added end-of-test detection in `TypingArea`, preventing further input and displaying a completion message.
- Added `onComplete` callback from `TypingArea` to `Home`, which now receives final progress, updates metrics (incl. final time), and clears the saved state upon completion.
- **Added a "Reset Test" button to the `Home` component, allowing users to restart the current test without reloading the text.**
- **Updated `MetricsDisplay` to optionally show the final time upon test completion.**
- **Refined overall layout (`Home`) for better centering and spacing.**
- **Increased `TypingArea` height, font size, and line-height for better readability.**
- **Adjusted caret styling (size, animation) and completion overlay appearance.**
- **Improved styling of `MetricsDisplay` (alignment, font weights/sizes).**
- **Dimmed untyped text further and adjusted incorrect character styling in `CharSpan`.**
- **Added custom caret blink animation in `globals.css`.**
- **Installed `react-hot-toast` library.**
- **Added `<Toaster />` component to `Home` page for displaying notifications.**
- **Replaced all `alert()` calls in `InputArea` with `toast.loading()`, `toast.success()`, and `toast.error()` for non-blocking feedback.**
- **Updated loading overlay in `InputArea` to show a spinner instead of text (as toasts now handle messages).**

**Key Decisions:**
- Use `pdfjs-dist` for client-side PDF text extraction first.
- Use `Tesseract.js` for OCR, both as a fallback for PDFs and directly for images.
- Use `cdnjs` for the PDF.js worker source for simplicity.
- Set a character count threshold (e.g., 50 chars) to determine if direct PDF extraction was successful enough to skip OCR.
- Handle errors separately for direct extraction and OCR steps.
- Provide clearer loading messages, including OCR progress percentage.
- Terminate the Tesseract worker (`worker.terminate()`) after each recognition task to free up resources.
- Manage an `isCompleted` state in `TypingArea` and `Home`.
- Prevent keyboard input and caret display when `isCompleted` is true.
- Show a visual overlay indicating completion.
- Clear `localStorage` via `onComplete` callback to prevent reloading a finished test.
- **Implement `handleManualReset` in `Home` to clear progress/state and trigger `TypingArea` reset via `resetTrigger`.**
- **Pass final time and completion status to `MetricsDisplay` to conditionally show final stats.**
- **Prioritize readability and cleaner look in styling adjustments (larger fonts, better spacing).**
- **Use Tailwind CSS utility classes primarily for styling.**
- **Introduce custom CSS animation for smoother caret blinking.**
- **Use `react-hot-toast` for non-blocking user feedback.**
- **Display specific error messages in toasts.**
- **Use loading toasts (`toast.loading`) to provide feedback during longer operations (file read, OCR).**

**Next Steps:**
- Refine UI/UX aspects (e.g., end-of-test summary, more sophisticated loading indicators/progress bars).
- Implement improved loading/error UI (non-blocking notifications).
- Adjust styling to more closely match the Monkeytype aesthetic.
- Consider performance implications of client-side OCR.
- Test thoroughly.
- Explore adding more Tesseract languages.
- Final code review and cleanup.
